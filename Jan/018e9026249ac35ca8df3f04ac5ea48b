 NINETY drummers are set to benefit from this year’s edition of Drum Clinic workshop pencilled for February courtesy of Zimbabwe Drum Fiesta.
This year’s event will be held virtually in line with Covid-19 national lockdown regulations. “The main purpose of the event is to teach and celebrate Zimbabwean drumming. We will be hosting upcoming, intermediate and professional drummers during the event,” one of the event organisers Carlton Mparutsa, who dabbles as Suluman Chimbetu’s manager, said. Other organisers of the event include Tino “Beatboy” Damba, Praymore “Dhudcha” Dziva, Collen Tom, Obert “Musorowembudzi” Gomba and Dennis Mushaishi. Over the years, Gomba worked with popular names in the music industry including Leonard Zhakata and Alick Macheso, showcasing his top-notch drumming skills. “Since we are going to conduct the workshop from different locations due to Covid-19, we are expecting about 90 drummers to participate,” he said. The exact date will be announced in due course, according to the organisers. Due to the Covid-19 national lockdown, most of the arts events have been held online in line with the pandemic regulations. Some of these events include Simon Chimbetu commemorations, Macheso birthday bash, Shoko and Let Them festivals. Sponsored Links
