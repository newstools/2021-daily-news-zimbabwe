 Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO BULAWAYO-based author and publisher Marshal Chiza has finally settled for January for the release of his book that exclusively looks at the country’s first citizen, President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Titled Dear Emmerson, the book was edited by United Kingdom-based Brilliant Pongo and published by Billionaire Publishers. While the book was printed in August, Chiza kept it away from the public as he has been looking for a perfect launch that befits the publication that talks about the country’s first citizen. “There have been two factors that caused the delay in launching the book. “First, the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown regulations have made it almost impossible for me to work on the launch. However, the regulations have been relaxed a bit so there is hope now. “Secondly the big reason is I can’t launch the book without the consent of the president, since the book is about him. So I can safely say I have been engaging the relevant authorities in that regard and we have progressed well,” Chiza told the Daily News. The author said the launch is certainly going to take place in Harare in January although he could not avail the dates and venue. “All the details will be made available very soon.” Chiza said Dear Emmerson tries to unravel a luminous memoir of “a good man who is misunderstood”. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  He feels that through the book he is simply trying to tell the untold story of Mnangagwa. “Writing a book like this one humbles me as I narrate the good tidings the president has done thus far, though I have so much agitation in tackling this book because it is as intense as carrying the fate of my generation. “I felt that I must write about this so that posterity and those of my generation may get to know that in him we had an icon in our midst.” In his review, the book’s editor Pongo describes the work as a compelling and revealing narrative of contemporary Zimbabwean politics. The book is segmented into seven chapters; Understanding the Zimbabwean Mindset, The Ascension — A Closer Look (Who is Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa?), Emmerson or Robert?, Soft as Wool, The President’s  Foreign Diplomatic Drive, Great but Misunderstood and The Zimbabwe I would Want to See — Dear Emmerson. The 22-year-old Chiza is an author, motivational speaker and entrepreneur. He has published three books; Success In No Time, Poor Billionaire and Before I become a Billionaire. He wrote his first book when he was just 18. Chiza also heads a charity called Poor Billionaire Foundation which he founded in 2018. Sponsored Links
