 ZIMBABWE senior women’s cricket team will return to action for the first time since May 2019 with an international date at home against Pakistan next month in Harare, the cricket governing body said.
The locals were suspended from all forms of cricket by the International Cricket Council in July 2019, two months after winning the ICC Women Africa Qualifiers at home, over government interference. Subsequently, the women were stripped of their right to represent Africa at the Global Qualifiers in Scotland, resulting in losing finalists Namibia being named as their replacement. The impeding series comprises three one-day games and two T20 matches at Harare Sports Club from February 11 to 20 but is subject to approval by the government. Both sides will be using the tour as part of their build-up for the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier 2021 scheduled for June and July. The top three teams from the 10-team tournament will qualify for the ICC Women’s Cricket 50-over World Cup 2022 set for New Zealand. Lady Chevrons were scheduled to tour Namibia this month but the plans were put off following the suspension of all sporting activities by the government due to the increase in local Covid-19 transmissions and deaths. The Sports and Recreation Commission, however, said clearing of tours or tournaments, local, regional and international, during this blanket ban will be carried out on a case by case basis. “The proposed tour, which is subject to approval from the government of Zimbabwe due to the Covid-19 restrictions currently in place, will be held in a bio-secure bubble with no spectators allowed at the match venue,” ZC spokesperson Darlington Majonga said in a statement. “The Pakistan senior women’s team are currently touring South Africa and agreed to a stop-over in Harare after ZC engaged the Pakistan Cricket Board prior to the latest Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. “But ZC, having already successfully hosted domestic competitions in a controlled environment, will host the series in a bio-secure bubble in order to greatly minimise the risk of the coronavirus spreading.” The series is scheduled to bowl off with the one-day games on February 11, 13 and 15 while the shorter version of the game, the T20, concludes the bilateral engagement on February 18 and 20. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “Stringent protocols for the proposed tour are already in place, with the ZC Covid-19 Committee, which includes the organisation’s chief medical officer Dr Solomon Madzogo, meeting twice a week to ensure all is in place for a safe series,” added Majonga.
