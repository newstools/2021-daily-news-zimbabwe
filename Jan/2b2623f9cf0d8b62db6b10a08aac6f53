POLICE are worried with the continued arrest and interception of people moving around with fake Covid-19 PCR test certificates as Zimbabwe continues to battle the spread of the pandemic.
Numerous people are now being arrested at most border posts with forged PCR tests certificates intending to leave Zimbabwe for neighbouring countries like South Africa and Mozambique. Last week, both Zimbabwe and South Africa authorities were discovering daily at least 50 travellers with fake PCR results. On Thursday, four people were found with the fake certificates at the Robert Mugabe International Airport intending to fly out. Inorder to combat the spread of the virus, travellers are required to present test certificates which have been issued in the last 48 hours. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police is investigating circumstances in which four suspects were found with fake and doctored Covid-19 certificates at Robert Mugabe International Airport on January 7. “This defeats the whole fight against Covid-19 and puts the lives of people at risk,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi told the Daily News on Sunday yesterday. With the country currently under lockdown, movement is restricted and other people are reportedly using fake exemption letters to have passage at police checkpoints. Nyathi said those who will be caught on the wrong side would be arrested. “Those who will be found with fake exemption letters to move from one place to another at police checkpoints will be arrested,” Nyathi said. Recently two people, Takesure Kanyani and Tariro Chimhavi, were arrested and taken to court on allegations of forging Covid-19 certificates and selling them to travellers intending to leave the country at Roadport Bus Station.
