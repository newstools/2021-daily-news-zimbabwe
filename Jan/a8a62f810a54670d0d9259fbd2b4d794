 Blessings Mashaya SENIOR STAFF WRITER mashayab@dailynews.co.zw FIRST Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, pictured,  has called for women to fast and pray starting today until Saturday in order for Zimbabwe to beat the current Covid-19 second wave. This comes as the country has been recording an alarming increase of new infections and deaths since the start of the year.As of yesterday, Zimbabwe had recorded 825 deaths from the 28 675 confirmed cases since March 2020.It also comes as the nation was plunged into mourning following the death of Foreign Affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo from the lethal virus yesterday.“May I as the mother of the nation call upon all women in Zimbabwe, and all those abroad who may so wish, to join me in fasting and praying to the Lord, the Almighty from tomorrow (today) to Saturday for our nation to be spared from further calamity and suffering. Our country has witnessed a lot of Covid19 deaths in the past two weeks.“Death is within our communities, at our doorstep. There is no family that has not suffered the loss of their beloved ones because of the pandemic.“Every day we hear of names that are succumbing. I thus humbly appeal to all women to commit to a three-day period from tomorrow in which we fast and pray calling for divine intervention to save the nation and our people,” Auxillia said in a statement.The first lady said women must make sure that their families respect Covid-19 protocols like wearing masks, sanitising and maintaining physical distancing at all times.“As women, we play a very important role in our society. We hold the family unit together and get it to work for our daily life. Being on the ground at all times, we are the custodians of values and measures that protect us at the smallest unit of society.“I call upon you that as we pray to the Almighty for his mercy and grace, we also use that power bestowed upon us by society to ensure that every family is abiding by the measures that have been put in place by the government to curtail the spread of the infectious disease. As mothers, let us enforce compliance at the family level with measures that reduce the spread of Covid19 amongst us,” the first lady said.She also said there is need to fight stigmatisation on those who have been infected by the deadly virus adding that traditional chiefs must have awareness campaigns against the spread of the disease.“As we pray for relief in our nation, we should observe the measures for safe praying.“The best is to fast and pray as individuals in our homes. For those that congregate in small numbers as allowed by the Covid19 regulations, let us mask up and observe safe physical distancing from each other.“In the same vein, I implore our mass media organisations, print, television, radio, online platforms, to help in getting the message across by hyping up your communication that helps the nation to pray together and to observe the measures that keep us safe,” Auxillia said.
