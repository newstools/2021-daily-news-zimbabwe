 Austin Karonga SENIOR SPORTS WRITER karongaa@dailynews.co.zw  RODWELL Chinyengetere has completed his permanent return to FC Platinum after signing a year-long contract, the Daily News has learnt. Chinyengetere returned to FC Platinum on a loan deal from SA side Baroka FC where his game time was limited. The forward defied a career- threatening injury to emerge as the country’s top player in two successive years, 2017 and 2018 guiding the platinum miners to their first premiership titles. The second year’s crowning moment was even sweeter for the midfielder as he also bagged the golden boot with his 17 goals in the 2018 season. His exploits didn’t go unnoticed as South Africa’s Baroka FC came calling but he found the going tough across the Limpopo and was loaned back to FC Platinum during the second half of the 2019 Castle Premier Soccer League. The two-time Zimbabwe Footballer of the Year was on hand to help the Zvishavane-based side pip CAPS United to the title right on the final day of the season. Chinyengetere featured in the move that led to Platinum’s only goal of the match that was scored by Perfect Chikwende who has since left the Zimbabwe champions to join Simba Sports Club of Tanzania. “Exciting news for the club, Roddy needs no introduction. He was instrumental in bringing honours to the club and he was the league’s star performer in the two years that FC Platinum lifted their first two titles and you can never say no to such a good servant when the opportunity to bring home presents itself,” a source told the Daily News yesterday. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “The fact that he was here on loan from Baroka speaks volume on how much the player is highly regarded at the club. It is everyone’s fervent hope that we continue scaling greater heights because he is a tried and tested formula we all know that everything he touches turns to gold. We can’t wait for the games to begin.” FC Platinum have reportedly signed defender Blessing Moyo from Dynamos and are also chasing the signature of CAPS United’s Innocent Mucheneka as direct replacement for enterprising forward Chikwende who is now with Simba SC. “We are a highly ambitious side and we don’t take comfort in the success of yesteryear, we are looking to dominate the local premiership for as long as it may take. So far we have done well locally but we still want to build a team that can compete and conquer on the continent,” added the source. Then turning out for Hwange in the 2012 season Chinyengetere suffered a horrific injury after Monomotapa goalkeeper Artwell Mukandi lunged at him with an over the top tackle inside the box. The Hwange captain was side-lined for eight weeks but Mukandi redeemed himself with a sportsmanship gesture as he visited the injured forward in hospital. “When I went to see him in hospital I told him how sorry I was. He said ‘its okay’ but I could tell deep inside he must have been really frustrated,” said Mukandi. “I also saw his family members. I just hope he gets well soon. “These things just happen unexpectedly. I’m still hurting right now. I can’t describe the stress this whole thing brought me.” Efforts to get a comment from FC Platinum were unsuccessful. Sponsored Links
