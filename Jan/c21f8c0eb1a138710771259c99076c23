 Aaron Nhawu SPORTS WRITER nhawua@dailynews.co.zw HOCKEY Association Zimbabwe (Haz) has announced a reduced squad for the U21 ladies team that is set to participate in the Junior Africa Cup of Nations scheduled for Accra, Ghana in March.
The tournament will be used as a platform to qualify for the Junior World Cup which will be held in South Africa at the end of the year with the dates yet to be announced. The 23-member squad includes star players such as Munashe Dangare, Taya Trivella, and Carla Goodinson among others while the final 18 players will be announced in due course. With the government earlier banning all sporting activities in the country to minimise the spread of Covid-19, Haz has turned to other alternatives to maintain players’ fitness and well-being. Hockey ladies team coach Tendai Maredza said the situation is dire but remains hopeful they will find a way to go through physical training sessions. “We are in tough situations as  country but we are trying by all means in terms of complying with the government directive as far as staying home is concerned,” Maredza told the Daily News yesterday. “We are currently focusing on online training sessions until we are allowed to conduct face to face training when the coronavirus situation cools down. “We are trying by all means to motivate our players so that they remain focused in order to achieve our goals. The Haz board is also focusing on initiating a fundraising campaign. “We are focusing on the fundraising because we need over US$60 000 to cater for the team to travel to Ghana,” he added. “We are hoping to get some corporates to support us and any help will be greatly appreciated.” Earlier this month Haz engaged Africa Hockey requesting for the postponement of the Central Southern Africa tournament set to be hosted by Zimbabwe next month due to the surge of coronavirus cases in the country.
