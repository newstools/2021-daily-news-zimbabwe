  THE mutual love for Zimbabwean fashion sparked the idea for two young female entrepreneurs to start a fashion brand. FungaixRufaro is a new Zimbabwean fashion clothing brand that is on the rise, started by United Kingdom-based Zimbabweans, Fungai Muzoroza and Rufaro Kasukuwere.
“We want to create something that everyone can love and find a representation of themselves in what we make.
“FungaixRufaro was always something we talked about and had the intention to start it later on in life although we eventually started off in 2019. “It took us eight months to start designing, sourcing materials, commencing production and then releasing our first collection,” a FungaixRufaro representative told the Daily News. FungaixRufaro designed their own clothing and sourced materials in the UK for their first two collections. Kasukuwere and Muzoroza are university students in the UK; hence they have to balance school with entrepreneurship in Zimbabwe. “For our most recent collection — Takangodaro — all our materials were sourced in Zimbabwe and the production was done there as well. “We would say that one of our main sources of inspiration is our desire to revolutionise the fashion and creative industry in Zimbabwe and make it a more respectable field.” Their clothing range comes in all sizes and is uniquely made to measure because of different body types. “We don’t want anyone to feel as though they can’t wear what we make because it’s for a specific body type. We want to create something that when you wear it you know that it’s yours and your clothes feel like they belong to you and only you,” the representative said. FungaixRufaro designs and creations can be found on their Instagram page. Sponsored Links
