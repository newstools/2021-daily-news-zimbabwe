By Black Edward LET’S face it. Nobody likes to talk about death all the time. That’s why sometimes Covid-19 has to take a back seat to jokes about other issues as a way of relieving stress.
One such issue that we should take a lighter look at is incompetence. If you think about it, incompetence has become some kind of virus attacking our immune system.
And it’s unfortunate that multiple incompetence virus variants are spreading quickly across the country: A variant called corruption emerged way back with an unusually large number of mutations. This variant’s ability to bind onto the human cells is very effective. In fact mutations in the virus allow it to bind to cells more deeply and effectively.
Another variant called looting also emerged soon after independence. Earlier research shows that the variant has 30 mutations, is stronger and spreads faster.
In addition the country is currently facing the full force of the incompetence second (some say third) wave. The call for action has become louder than ever, especially in Harare, where the incompetence virus will spread much easier in the coming winter months.
For proof of this incompetence just walk along the streets or look around you. Incompetent leadership, which is hindering attainment of goals, is everywhere.
It’s a pity that some organisations have a virulent culture, they perform less well than expected, and will eventually collapse as a result of incompetent leadership.
Incompetent leaders, simply put, are leaders who have consistently failed to perform satisfactorily in their roles. However, they’ve an uncanny ability to cling on to their jobs despite failings. They often make ill planned, miscalculated decisions.
Experts say characteristics of incompetence include; lying, lack of insight and understanding, ineffective task management and failure to deliver on goals. They say a leader who keeps to himself may seem cold and uncaring. The result of his detachment and lack of availability often leads to lack of direction, insufficient feedback on progress and poor clarity around expectations.
Incompetence of some leaders has resulted in growing political tensions and a shattered economy, negatively affecting our lifestyle. That’s not to say we don’t have competent leaders who cause high levels of trust, engagement, and productivity. They are there and we thank them for doing well. Keep up the good work.
Like I said the call for action has become louder to deal with the incompetent ones. What can be done? Well, let’s consider a jab against incompetence? Yes, a shot — figuratively speaking of course.
Remember, vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them.
It normally takes 15 to 20 years to develop a vaccine, but due to the urgency of the incompetence pandemic, researchers must accelerate the vaccine development process.
Currently, there are no incompetence vaccines — a sad state of affairs, considering researchers learned about the incompetence pandemic in 1980.
While vaccine trials generally start with healthy adults who have not been infected with the virus, researchers must target top officials, particularly politicians.
Councillors and people with high-exposure jobs should be prioritised before the vaccine is made available to the general populace.
And we should guard against situations where one group has all the vaccines while outbreaks are happening elsewhere. We’re not going to be safe from incompetence until we’re completely safe everywhere.
Front-line workers, we are referring to top officials here, will play a key role in encouraging people to receive vaccines against incompetence since the search is now happening at a time when vaccine hesitancy is at an all-time high.
We’re banking on education and reminding people about the historical success of other vaccines for the success of the project.
It’s also crucial to state the goal of vaccine development, whether that’s for incompetence or any other disease.
In this instance our goal is to keep people from being incompetent — from getting infected and from being super-spreaders. We want to keep Zimbabweans healthy and functional.
People need to understand that vaccination is safe and is an effective way to prevent the disease and save others.
By the way, getting a shot isn’t that enticing, but we can do something to make it bearable. One way is to make people feel as comfortable as possible during the process.
Our vaccination centres must offer easy access and eliminate waiting times. Convenience is key during vaccination. We should be able to provide urgent attention to those who need it.
Well, what’s your take on it?   Sponsored Links
