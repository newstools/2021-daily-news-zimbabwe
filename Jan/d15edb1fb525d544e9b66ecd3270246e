chayav@dailynews.co.zw RHUMBA musician and dancer Lady Storm also known as Eriza has hit hard times as the Covid-19 national
lockdown takes its toll on the arts sector.
Real name Lyn Magodo, the musician earned the moniker Eriza after featuring in Jah Prayzah’s video Eriza off the blockbuster studio album Jerusarema. “Things are really tight for me. The extended lockdown has worsened my plight. I have tried to venture into business but to no avail. My survival is now hinged on well-wishers’ benevolences,” the mother of one said. Eriza’s situation has been worsened by her divorce from Tinarwo Gotora who was the breadwinner. “I am leaving everything to God. I have a serious backlog in rentals. I do not even know when I will get the money for rentals. In short, the lockdown has affected me to the bone and it is a challenging experience for me,” she said. The Covid-19 national lockdown was put in place by the government in March last year to curb the spread of the deadly pathogen. Late last year, the government partially lifted the ban on the low risk arts sector including theatre, poetry and sculpting among others leaving the music industry on the ban. The development affected musicians to a greater extent. As a result, the majority of musicians have turned their focus on other income-generating ventures including farming, mining and vending to put food on their families’ tables. The recently announced raft of lockdown measures by the government has worsened musicians’ plight. Since last year, music promoters have been lobbying the authorities. “We would like to plead with the government through our mother body National Arts Council of Zimbabwe to reconsider our arts sector. Surely we are the hardest hit sector considering that since March we were unable to hold events due to Covid-19 national lockdown,” the chairperson of Promoters in Zimbabwe Partson ‘‘Chipaz’’ Chimbodza said. Chimbodza who is also the director of Chipaz Promotions said promoters are willing to enforce all the Covid-19 guidelines on the concerts. “We used to do events in stadiums that could attract over 10 000 fans and it is our hope that at least they (relevant authorities) reconsider and allow us to operate at quarter capacity of any joint or venue,” he said.
