 Vasco Chaya and Anesu Mirisawu LIFESTYLE WRITERS ABOUT 100 musicians from about 1 000 that applied for the Covid-19 Relief Fund last year have received $5 000 each, the Zimbabwe Union of Musicians (Zum) has confirmed. The government unveiled the $10 million fund last year to cushion artists from the effects of the Covid-19-induced national lockdown that was put in place in March. The grant was not limited to musicians but also encompassed other artists like sculptors, poets and painters among others. A total 2 899 artists, including musicians, applied for the grant. “Tn total we have less than 100 that have confirmed receiving the $5 000 from about 1 000 members who applied for the Covid-19 relief fund,” Zum chairperson Edith WeUtonga said. Weutonga’s organisation boasts over 1 500 members. The deadline for the applications was July 31 last year and up to today, the bulk of the artists who applied are still waiting to be cushioned. According to a statement from the government that was released just after the applications’ deadline, Matabeleland North had the highest number of artists that applied for relief, followed by Harare with 486, Midlands 469, Masvingo 279, Manicaland 260, Bulawayo 224, Mashonaland East 144, Mashonaland Central 140, Mashonaland West 129 and Matabeleland South 93. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  Efforts to obtain the exact number of artists that benefitted from the Covid-19 Relief Fund were fruitless by the time of going to print yesterday as ministry of Arts officials were still to get to respond to inquiries from the Daily News Sponsored Links
