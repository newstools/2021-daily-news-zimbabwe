 NATIONAL Housing minister Daniel Garwe last week made startling revelations that 80 percent of residential land in the country is in the hands of just 15 land barons.
What is astounding is how that was allowed to happen! “It is sad to note that only 15 land barons own around 80 percent of residential land space in the country. Some of the barons acquired the State land for a song and are now overcharging desperate homeseekers,” Garwe told our sister publication, the Daily News, last week. This is corruption writ large! Garwe said his ministry was finalising an audit into residential land and was perplexed with preliminary results. It’s high time the government gets to the bottom of the land scam and expose the land barons. Homeseekers have been at the mercy of these unscrupulous land barons for too long. Cases of unsuspecting home-seekers who are swindled of their hard earned money by the unscrupulous land barons and housing cooperative bosses are on the rise in the country. Garwe must be commended for instituting an audit into the ownership of residential land. There has been a mushrooming of land barons and developers; and government must act forthwith. Over a decade ago, the government at some point pledged to develop a Housing Development Act to protect the public from insatiable land developers and barons. This has, however, remained just that as has happened to many other promises by different ministries to curb vice in the country. What boggles the mind is most of these land barons and developers get away “scot free” and are known for flaunting their ill-gotten wealth, purchasing expensive cars and funding their lavish lifestyles. There have been reports that some of these land barons are “immune” to prosecution because of their political connections. Such cases must be investigated lest more people lose money buying non-existent residential stands. There is a need for the government to strongly monitor operations of housing trusts and cooperatives. We hope Garwe is sincere that soon the land barons would be held accountable and those who fall foul of the law would face the legal consequences. Garwe said: “Desperate home-seekers have lost life savings to land barons. As authorities we cannot fold our arms and watch. We need to rein in the chaos and restore order and sanity in the national housing sector. Those who have duped desperate home-seekers will face the full wrath of the law.” Let’s pray Garwe will have more bite than bark! Sponsored Links
