Officials say the awards will be a unique event in the sense that on the night we shall honour 40 legends as we celebrate 40 years of independence, dubbed Nama Legends Awards #Namalegends.” Meanwhile Zima  spokesperson Benjamin Nyandoro announced in a statement: “Zima wishes to inform all music stakeholders that the Zima 2021 awards ceremony has been rescheduled .This has been necessitated by the on-going developments around concerted efforts to curtail the further spread of Covid-19 and possibly finding a lasting solution to this pandemic.” Nyandoro said there is hope that by February 20 the environment might be favourable: “We hope that by February 20 the environment will be more conducive to hold the awards ceremony while still adhering to safe health practices.” Nyandoro also mentioned the need to follow Covid-19 protocols which also necessitated the change of dates.
