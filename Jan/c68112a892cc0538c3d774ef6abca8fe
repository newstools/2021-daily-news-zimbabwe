Godknows Matarutse SENIOR STAFF WRITER matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw HARARE City Council (HCC) has warned illegal commuter omnibuses and vendors defying lockdown regulations and entering the Central Business District (CBD) that they will face the full wrath of the law. Zimbabwe entered a second hard lockdown on Tuesday for the next 30 days as the government tries to slow down the rate of infections and Covid-19 deaths that have surged in the last two weeks. But while the majority of people heeded the call to stay at home, acting Harare mayor Stewart Mutizwa yesterday noted with concern that a few misguided elements chose to defy the lockdown directive. Addressing a press conference in the capital yesterday, Mutizwa said council would brook no nonsense during the lockdown — adding the city, together with other government arms, would do everything in their power to make sure that vendors and kombis stay out of the CBD. “The city would want to warn vendors and other small to medium enterprises that have defied the government directive and continue to operate that the long arm of the law will catch up with them and they should stop all their operations forthwith. “Transport operators continue plying certain routes in the city, mainly those that do not pass through the central business district. “These routes include Dzivaresekwa-Machipisa, Westgate-Warren Park, Machipisa-Chitungwiza and other routes in the city. “I would like to urge transport operators to consider the health of fellow residents ahead of monetary gain,” Mutizwa said. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); The mayor said the city’s health facilities have been stretched by the resurgence of the virus. “Our frontline staff is already overwhelmed and let us not overburden them purposely. “Let us put the little resources to good use by allowing only deserving patients to access them. “We do not want to see unlicensed commuter omnibuses on our roads, evading law enforcement agents yet spreading diseases. “We want people indoors for the good of society, not for selfish reasons. “In the same vein, let me urge residents to stay indoors and help the nation to fight this pandemic. Together we can beat this,” Mutizwa said. Sponsored Links
