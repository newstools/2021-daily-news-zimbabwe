  By Godknows Matarutse and Tamary Chikiwa SMALL traders say they are disappointed that authorities imposed a lockdown without cushioning them for the duration of the restrictions. On the other hand, retailers welcomed the lockdown and urged supermarkets to decongest their shops as part of enforcing adherence to Covid-19 safety guidelines and protocols. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, small traders said the government should have considered a stimulus package for those in the informal sector as they were likely to come off worse during the lockdown. President of the Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation (Viset), Samuel Wadzai, said they were worried that some of their members would not recover from the effects of a second lockdown. “Viset is of the view that as with the first lockdown, there is a disproportionate negative focus on the informal sector, which has been closed in totality whilst formal businesses have been exempted, yet as is well known, our membership is the one that is severely affected by the economic meltdown that this country has long been experiencing. “To add insult to injury, these measures are implemented without any mitigatory interventions such as social grants much as with the first lockdown where despite numerous pronouncements of support for the informal sector, reports surfaced of corruption in allocation of these funds. “Viset is well aware and appreciates the precarious situation the country faces with regards to the Covid-19 pandemic, but feels that there is an inordinate focus on the economically marginalised and that vendors must be allowed to operate within strict confines of World Health Organisation (WHO) Covid-19 regulations. “It is also our belief that the lockdown in itself is not enough but should be coupled with other measures such as provision of social grants, personal protective equipment, sanitisers and greater awareness campaigns,” Wadzai said. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); In Bulawayo, the informal traders appealed to the authorities for permission to continue operating during the lockdown period. The Informal Economy Agenda Coalition (IEAC) said the sector was alive to the danger posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and pledged to adhere to the laid down regulations. “It is of concern that there are no provisions for social protection of vulnerable people such as informal traders. We are concerned that market places will be totally shut. “It would be preferable if licensed traders were allowed to continue operating under strict Covid-19 protocols,” the group said in a statement. “The Bulawayo’s Traders Association has already made significant strides in providing materials such as hand sanitisers, masks and water dispensers for washing hands in over 22 markets in the city. “We also welcome the government’s efforts to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. For our part we wish to work with the government for a win-win solution … in terms of policy implementation, particularly on the current lockdown measures,” the coalition also said. “We are in an extraordinary situation which calls for extraordinary measures and discarding the business-as-usual approach, therefore, we should adhere to Covid-19 guidelines. “The measures are necessary to save lives. “CZR calls upon members to adhere to the new measures, which means opening and closing shops within the set timelines. CZR believes we will flatten the curve if we have all hands on deck,” said CZR president Denford Mutashu. Sponsored Links
