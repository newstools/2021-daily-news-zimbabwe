Myles Matarise STAFF WRITER matarisem@dailynews.co.zw THE government will secure the area around the Victoria Falls gorge to avoid repeats of tragic incidents similar to the one that killed a Harare man over the festive season. This comes as search units that include ZimParks rangers, police and the military are battling to retrieve the body of Roy George Tinashe Dikinya –who plunged to his death at the gorge while taking pictures with a friend. His  body has since been located some 100m at the falls’ Danger Point.     googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Ndhlovu also revealed how delicate and difficult the process to retrieve Dikinya’s body was as he gave progress made to date. Dikinya’s death happened at a time when the Victoria Falls is experiencing heavy inflows from the Zambezi River owing to the recent local and regional rains. The Zambezi River Authority this week said an estimated 513 cubic metres per second were flowing into the Victoria Falls as of December 23, 2020. This is a steady rise from 302 cubic metres per second at the same time in 2019. In April 2020 when the flow into Victoria Falls was low, Elmon Muleya, 29, from Victoria Falls town cheated death after he fell into a gorge in the Zambezi River and a boulder landed on him, crushing both legs. In 2005, a tourist from Johannesburg died on New Year’s Eve when he fell 40m down a rock face at the Victoria Falls while trying to recover spectacles he had dropped.   Sponsored Links
