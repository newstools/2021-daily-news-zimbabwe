MUSICIANS in Bulawayo have painted a gloomy outlook for 2021 and appealed to government for intervention. This comes as government this month imposed a 30-day lockdown to fight the second Covid-19 wave that is ravaging communities.
Jazz musician Jeys Marabini said the situation is bad for musicians. “It’s been a long time now under lockdown and this second wave has worsened the situation. As it is, it has been difficult to get shows. Musicians are suffering, surviving solely on selling music online, so the situation is bad. The industry here has been grossly affected. Government should have the art industry at heart and help us.” Award-winning and globetrotting Bulawayo diva Noma Nkwali said all was not well. “It’s very difficult; nothing is moving, no live shows, no live Facebook shows as well. We can’t even sell our CDs to our fans, we rely on online sales. We are surviving on God’s grace. The world is going through a very difficult phase “I am lucky to be locked down at home with my family, we pray together, we keep ourselves at home we don’t move around unnecessarily and hope for the best. I would like to encourage everyone to keep safe, mask up, stay home, wash hands.” High riding queen of swag Sandra Ndebele also shared her pain. “Lockdown has really pulled us back as musicians in a very big way but I think it’s high time we utilise online platforms to try and eke out a living because this pandemic is still with us. We need to devise new ways of survival as musicians.” Afro-pop musician Mzobanzi Mlauzi, better known as Mzoe 7, said: “Personally I feel very bad because in this time of pandemic and lockdown most people are depressed and need entertainment to have some hope. I can’t give them that. Financially, we have been crippled; the year seemed fruitful and promising as I had engaged a number of corporates for online partnerships but that hasn’t been possible since we are on lockdown.” ZimDancehall musician Emmanuel Majaya, better known as Bovas, said: “Covid-19 has affected us in a huge way, especially financially. We were used to staging shows weekly which gave us much needed income. With lockdown imposed on our employers, which are the clubs, we cannot perform anywhere. It’s now punishable at law; look what happened to DJ Fantan and Levels. Sponsored Links
