Tamary Chikiwa in BULAWAYO NATIONAL Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) acting general manager Joseph Mashika has died. NNRZ board chairperson Martin Dinha told the Daily News that Mashika passed on at a private clinic in the capital on Sunday. He succumbed to an undisclosed illness. Mashika was 44 and is survived by his wife, Nomatter, and four children. Dinha described Mashika as a dedicated and hard working man whose death has robbed NRZ of a promising future for the transport giant. “Mashika demonstrated strong performance ever since his appointment as the general manager and the future was bright,” Dinha said. Mashika was appointed NRZ acting general manager in August 2020, a position he held with great distinction, added Dinha. Prior to his appointment, he served as a NRZ board member for six years. “NRZ has shown great resilience and strength over the past months because Mashika has been a remarkable leader during an extraordinary period of challenges,” the NRZ board chairperson added. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Dinha said another hallmark of his leadership was building a team of management that was committed to the revival of the NRZ. “He was a great leader who will be sadly missed. We take comfort in that our life and destinies are determined by the Lord. “Job 1:21: The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised. NRZ wants to express its heartfelt condolences to his wife, children and the family for this untimely death,” Dinha said Sponsored Links
