 Blessing Masakadza SENIOR STAFF WRITER masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw DENDERA musician Tryson Chimbetu says the title of his latest album — Chii Chakadaro — is not meant as an affront to fellow dendera musicians Suluman and Allan’s latest offerings. Tryson’s new project was released hot on the heels of Suluman’s album titled Entanglement and that of Allan — Urgent Matter — which were dropped towards the end of last year. However, speculation in music circles is that this was a direct attack on Suluman and Allan by Tryson since the title translates to “What’s that?” Tryson, who’s known as Sekuru Dhimba by his legion of fans, told the Daily News that the title was meant to get people talking and at the same time, help lure the younger generation to dendera music. “My focus is to take dendera music to the next generation and doing so means being able to engage with the people in that generation by using the language they understand. “Chii Chakadaro is a phrase in street lingo which the youth understand. I’m the second generation of dendera and for it to get to the third generation, it has to relate with the people,” he said. Tryson said this is similar to the title of his 2019 album Kana Mazogara, which carried the hit song Mai Maria. Regarded by some as the ‘Prince of Dendera’, Tryson has experimented with the sound of the genre on this latest album, with listeners saying he is borrowing from rhumba. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  “Dendera music cuts across genres and the pioneers would borrow from kanindo and rhumba. “You can identify the styles from the way they dressed or even the haircuts. They borrowed from other genres which is what I’m doing and improving to ensure we widen the audience. This is the reason I work with singers from Zim dancehall,” he said. On the album, Sekuru Dhimba has engaged other singers such as gospel musician Daniel Mhere, rapper Ti Gonzi and Uncle Sam. He has also worked with the rising Mhondoro Mbira outfit Madzinza Embira on one of the songs Zimbabwe, which is winning the hearts of his followers. “The idea is to broaden the audience and break new ground. Like I said, the idea is to take dendera to the next generation and introduce something that can appeal to many,” Tryson said. The singer said work is already underway to market the new album but he is being hindered by the current hard Covid-19 national lockdown. Sponsored Links
