WE LIVE in a surreal world, a globe where false information peddlers are using social media to debase human dignity.
The purveyors of false information, disguised as news, have shown no respect for the sanctity of human life, especially in the last two weeks when Covid-19 started ravaging the country with a vengeance. News is not fake, it is a science of verifiable facts. But what we have been witnessing on social media, in most cases, is fake information. We have noted with disgust the gossip mongers falsely pronouncing the deaths of people from Covid-19 without a care for the consequences of such lies. Quite often, they don’t even bother to correct their false information even when it turns out to be nothing but a pack of lies. It is also disgusting that some citizens have taken to social media to celebrate the recent demise of some cabinet ministers and government officials, blaming them for the country’s poor economy. It is against our culture and tradition to scorn and speak ill of the dead. It is inhumane and must never be tolerated. Social media should not be used to defile our culture and tradition. In the advent of Covid-19, social media should be used to unite the people in the fight against coronavirus, which has now claimed close to 1 000 people and infected over 30 000 since it hit our shores in March last year. The nation needs unity of purpose in this fight. Social media should be used to educate the masses on the killer pandemic, how it can be curbed and what measures should be taken to fight it, not a tool to celebrate and announce false deaths. We solidly back President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s call in his State of the Nation Address on Saturday that the country must be united in the fight against the pandemic. As he pledged, the hope is the country will acquire vaccines soon to immunise Zimbabweans from the killer virus given that our public health delivery system is in a perilous state. The only way out is a vaccine and debate around that should dominate social media, not fake information. “Government has and is engaging countries which have developed vaccines. Help and relief are on the way. Our experts, who have been assessing different vaccines, are very close to finalising the course to recommend to our nation, a course which will bring relief and which we will roll out across the length and breadth of our nation so that  we do not lose more lives than has become inevitable, a course which ensures that the vaccines which we introduce in our bodies are both safe and effective,” Mnangagwa said.
