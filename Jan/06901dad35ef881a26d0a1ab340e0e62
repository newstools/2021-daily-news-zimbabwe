 By Tariro Sajeni and Perpetua Rojasi PARIRENYATWA Group of Hospitals and the Chitungwiza Health Department have been forced to scale down on their operations after their staff members were infected by Covid-19 in recent weeks. This comes as the country is experiencing a resurgence of the pandemic and 589 people have lost their lives from the 24 256 confirmed cases since March last year. Parirenyatwa has been forced to temporarily suspend attending to patients at its radiotherapy centre in the wake of rising infections among staff. “We would like to advise our patients on chemotherapy and the general public that our radiotherapy centre has not been spared the effects of Covid-19. “Some staff members and patients have been infected and this is posing serious risks. “Chemotherapy patients are most vulnerable as their immunity may be impaired by their treatment and disease. “In the meantime, hospital authorities are reviewing relevant protocols to safeguard both patients and staff; our doctors are reviewing patients on a case-by-case basis and making appropriate decisions,” Parirenyatwa spokesperson Linos Dhire said in a statement yesterday. Meanwhile, Chitungwiza City Health Department revealed that at least one of its staff members had passed away while seven have been infected by the deadly virus. As a result, the municipality has closed down one of its clinics in St Mary’s. “Even before the onset of the pandemic, Chitungwiza Municipality was short of health professionals. The current circumstances have worsened these shortages of qualified staff. “As a result of the current severe staff shortages, and with immediate effect, Chitungwiza Municipality will be temporarily closing one of its municipal clinics; that is St Mary’s Clinic. “This clinic shall remain open for emergency cases only; all non-emergency cases that would normally be attended to at St Mary’s shall be attended to at Zengeza Clinic for the time being,” Chitungwiza town clerk, Tonderai Kasu, said in a statement yesterday.
