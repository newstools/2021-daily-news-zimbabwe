 By Aaron Nhawu nhawua@dailynews.co.zw DESPITE the devastating effects Covid-19 has had on general life and the sporting calendar, the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) is looking forward to a better 2021.
This comes as the country has been plunged back into a lockdown and the government has banned all sporting activities for the next 30 days. ZVA secretary-general Enias Kondo appealed to the local volleyball fraternity to follow the recommended health guidelines during the lockdown. “l think for us, there is not much to fret about as long as it’s 30 days because we had dedicated the month of January to put our house in order. “We are going to hold our virtual extraordinary congress on January 16. “At the meeting, we will decide on our reconciliation of development plan and start planning as we finalise the calendar of events and make all corporate governance submissions to the Sports and Recreation Commission and the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee. “We had planned to resume on-court activity in February, so the impact might be minimal if we get the greenlight to resume by then,” Kondo told the Daily News. ZVA last month elected a new board in Masvingo with Mxolisi Ndlovu assuming the presidency while Kondo was elected secretary general. Farai Mboto and Sibangani Mashasha make up the new board after they were elected committee members. Regarding the game’s future in Zimbabwe, Kondo said they are pinning their hopes on a recently updated strategic plan and a 10-year development plan. “Expect a lot of activity revolving around the game on the court in all our codes. “Active national teams, ownership of beach volleyball, capacity development programmes and growth of ZVA brand shall be key in the next five years,” Kondo said.
