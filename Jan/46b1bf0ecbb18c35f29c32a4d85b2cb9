 AS ZIMBABWEAN musicians last year pondered their next move after government introduced the first national lockdown in March that banned gatherings, a saviour in the form of Nashtv was born. Nashtv went on to pre-record hundreds of musicians and screen their performances on national television, much to the delight of audiences across the country. The musicians were to benefit financially while for most it was the first time to reach wider audiences. The musicians varied from upcoming, established and aspiring. They covered all music genres spectrums from dancehall, sungura, gospel to mbira. Q: The year 2020 was a bleak one for local musicians and Nashtv came to their rescue and gave them a platform to remain relevant through live television broadcasts; why did you decide to create this platform? A: Nashtv is an online TV platform designed to plug existing gaps in the local arts industry, particularly during this Covid-19 pandemic where the world is reeling from lockdown and social distancing measures. The platform also seeks to herald and promote local talent at the same time creating opportunities for artistes to earn a living from their art. The concept has since grown into a recognised media player with a crucial role in the arts, business and development sectors through its quality content and productions.  Our goal is to tell the Zimbabwean story in a holistic manner at the same time creating opportunities for locals. Q: In total how many musicians did you feature on Nashtv last year? googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  A: Countless, I would say. We have various programmes and events that we host, some are themed according to partner taste and objectives while some are purely for entertainment and talent promotion purposes. We have since lost count of how many musicians we have worked with but we will continue availing opportunities for artistes from all walks of life, both established and upcoming. Q: What was the total financial package for the programme; of that what went to production and what went to musicians? A: Financial packages differ according to a programme or running promotion and we can’t categorically state figures as some are negotiated and some have little, if any, financial benefit. However, being a business pronged industry player, we always make sure our production teams and performing artistes get their dues at the same time, ensuring we keep Nashtv running. In some instances we forego the costs involved and reward the artiste for their commitment and pedigree. We are at the foundation stage but we believe this venture will be more rewarding as we grow into it. Q: The lockdown is continuing, what are your plans for this year? Are you reviving the programme and its concept? A: We have come this far and we don’t see ourselves stopping. Nashtv has become a lifestyle and we feel the only way to reward our loyal followers and audiences is to continue churning out good content that not only entertains but educates and informs our publics. We want our programming to be national and all-encompassing hence a deliberate focus on new content creation including drama. Our wish is to take the Nashtv initiative to all corners of Zimbabwe but again we remain alive to the challenges and limitations posed by the Covid-19 induced lockdown. We are covering all relevant and human interest issues including music, business as well as key developmental issues affecting human life. Artistes, corporates and development organisations remain some of our key partners in terms of content creation and design. Q: You seem to have a passion for music and the music sector; what drives you in this direction? A: I love life and I love people and my passion and investment in music is driven by a desire to bring a happy mood to my beloved country. Some say I am a successful businessman who has weathered all the storms of life and could be taking this as a pastime but I also believe we are blessed for others hence the expression of my regard for others through investing in local music and talent promotion. I have also built meaningful and cherished relationships with most Zimbabwean musicians and that counts for much. My wish is to see local musicians become household names across the globe at the same time earning meaningfully from their art. Giving my fellow Zimbabweans something to cheer about in a generally challenging environment is also a great motivation.  It may seem like a pipe dream for now but the possibilities are many. Q: As Nash Paints is there any mileage to this endeavour? A: Remember, Nash Holdings prides itself in mind-blowing creative edge and over the years we have tapped a lot from the artistic pool of artistes dating back to our engagement of Alick Macheso as our brand ambassador and later on a whole pool of musicians, models and even poets and comedians as brand influencers. We certainly see value in this endeavour though we have invested a lot materially and financially as part of our corporate social investment. Q: As you ran last year’s productions; what were some of the challenges you encountered? A: Like any other new venture, we faced various teething problems. Sometimes we would have network challenges resulting in aborted or postponed programming but all that was part of the process. In some instances we would have challenges reaching agreements with partners and artistes which we believe is not unique to us. The greater good and positives from Nashtv continue to motivate us and we are excited about the future. Q: You have in the past appointed some of the musicians as Nash Paints brand ambassadors; can you take us through some of the collaborations — the musicians you engaged and what was their role? A: We have worked with a whole coterie of musicians and arts industry players. Some with running contracts and some on a once-off arrangement but the long and short of it all is that these were win-win arrangements. Names that quickly come to mind include Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, ExQ, Lorraine Guyo, Madam Boss and the late Moana to name a few. We have had the “Kochekera-We paint Your House on credit” campaign and the “Ndisu Taipenda” campaign, among many others. Some of the arrangements bordered on specific brand activation initiatives while some were for jingles, advertising and product promotion. We have not had any challenges regarding that arrangement with musicians and others artistes and we will continue exploring it as and when necessary. Q: Artistically you have helped some of the musicians with their recordings, album launches and marketing of their products; which musicians are these? A: Countless, I would say. Some have not even come out in the open because it’s a venture we started way back even before Nash Paints became a household name. We believe in the potential of the local arts industry and we will continue supporting it. Q: Have you tried to create any partnerships with other corporates or even government on this noble vision? A: We have worked with various corporates in terms of talent promotion and product placement and we hope to continue exploring that avenue. With government we have continued to be supportive of national programmes like for example supporting the national fight against Covid-19 through risk awareness and public education. Our brand and the content we carry also projects the country and its potential in good light hence I believe we are contributing to the national good. Q: While you run this popular online television; do you have any plans to launch a fully-fledged television channel? A: The possibilities are too many and regulations and resources allowing we would be happy to contribute in telling the Zimbabwean story. A lot of good can come out of that and we remain hopeful that with growth we will attain that. Q: New television licences were recently issued by government; would you like to work with some of the players if opportunities arise? A: Collaboration is the way to go. We believe in multiplicity and where possible we don’t mind synergy. Q: The Covid-19 lockdown; how has it affected your business at Nash Paints? A: The Covid-19 induced lockdown means travel is restricted and the overall performance is generally limited. E-commerce is something we are yet to fully embrace as a country but we hope to tap into that moving into the future. Challenges and limitations aside, we remain hopeful. Q: What is your advice to musicians as the lockdown continues? A: I believe this lockdown has taught us the importance of preparing for the future and avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Musicians must be innovative and tap into the new way of doing things. They must explore creative ways of producing and selling their music online. They should also avoid risky behaviour and continue playing their role in the fight against this pandemic. They have the influence and voice to do that. Q: Anything that you may want to add? A: I just want to thank all our partners, musicians, corporates, organisations, the media and our government for the support and space they have afforded us to express and explore our local talent and dreams. We are really grateful for that support. Sponsored Links
