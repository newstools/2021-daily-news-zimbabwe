REAL Madrid ace Karim Benzema has praised Tino Kadewere after the Zimbabwe ended his barren spell by scoring a brace in Lyon’s 0-5 rout of St Etienne as he continues his steady rise where the Galactico also played. Kadewere had last scored for Lyon on December 23 in a 3-0 win over Nantes before hitting a three-match barren  spell. He failed to find the back of the net in Lyon’s 3-2 win over Lens on January 6, nil draw away at Rennes on January 9 and the 0-1 home defeat against Metz on January 17. The French national team striker Benzema rose through the youth academy ranks at Lyon after joining them in 1996. Benzema made his professional debut for Lyon in the 2004-05 season getting odd game time before becoming a starter in the 2007-08 season. He then left for Spain in July 2009 to join Real Madrid. Having been born in Lyon and honed his football skills at Olympique Lyon, Benzema has remained a keen follower of the club and when the Zimbabwean scored his brace on Sunday it did not go unnoticed. “Lyonnais tonight you can make a whole city proud and happy, we are all behind you. And Tino keep making your dreams come true,” read Benzema’s tweet. Kadewere, who has nine goals and three assists to his credit in 20 games in his debut season at Lyon, said he was chuffed by Benzema’s comment. “I am sure if I had seen this before the game, I was probably going to score more goals because getting a tweet from such a big player and someone I look up to really gives me motivation,” Kadewere told journalists after the match. “I’m really happy that one of the strikers that made me sign for Lyon is following my progress and happy with what I am doing. ‘That gives me confidence. I really want to thank him for his belief and support. “(To) play with Karim Benzema at Lyon or join him in Madrid? Regardless, playing with him would be a dream come true.” The former Harare City player opened the scoring for Lyon after 16 minutes with his left foot from a corner kick inside the box. The left boot came to the fore again for his second goal after locking the defender with his right before sending in a low shot past goalkeeper Jessy Moulin, this time getting an assist from his captain and fellow striker Memphis Depay in the 68th minute. “We are very happy. I’m happy to have scored this double. This victory is for our supporters. This will propel us to the end of the season. You build up trust,” Kadewere said of his performance. Sponsored Links
