 AFTER all football remains the world’s most beautiful sport as FC Platinum attacking midfielder Perfect Chikwende completed his move to Tanzanian giants Simba Sports Club barely a fortnight after the Zimbabwe champions’ debacle in Dar es Salaam. FC Platinum lost 0-4 to the Tanzanian champions on January 6 at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Dar es Salaam to crash out of the Caf Champions League tournament first round on a 1-4 aggregate. The platinum miners had won 1-0 in the first leg played at the National Sports Stadium in Harare. Events that ensued before the second leg in Tanzania where the locals reportedly played under protest after being subjected to poor treatment that included getting their Covid-19 results two hours before the match made it look as if there was no love lost between the two sides. But far from it, FC Platinum’s perfect treasurer was snapped up by Simba right on the last day of the transfer window in Tanzania. “FC Platinum today announces the transfer of Perfect Chikwende to Simba SC. We would like to thank Perfect Chikwende for his immense contribution at FC Platinum including attaining a league title; we wish him all the best in his new journey,” FC Platinum media liaison officer Chido Chizondo said in a statement. “The club will continue scouting for players locally and from other countries to buttress its squad with the aim of reaching the football powerhouse status on the continent.” Chikwende was targeted by Azam which is home to a couple of Zimbabwean players who include former FC Platinum midfielder Never Tigere, Warriors striker Prince Dube and former Highlanders left back Bruce Kangwa but it was Simba who flexed the bigger muscle to land the forward’s signature. Warriors’ fitness trainer Nyasha Charandura also joined Azam this year as the club’s sports scientist. Chikwende was the talk of Tanzania after a splendid performance in which he scored the solitary goal in FC Platinum’s 1-0 win over Simba in the Confederations of Africa Champions League first leg in Harare. Simba, however, overturned the result in the second leg hammering the Zimbabwe Champions 4-0 in the return leg played in Da res Salaam last weekend. Sponsored Links
