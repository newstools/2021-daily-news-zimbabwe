 POLICE have launched a manhunt for six armed robbers who pounced on a cashin-transit vehicle and got away with US$2,5 million in cash in yet another chilling robbery in the country.
National police spokesperson assistant commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday said three security guards were robbed along the Harare-Chinhoyi road on Wednesday afternoon near Gwebi Bridge by people they had offered a lift. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police is investigating the circumstances leading to an armed robbery which occurred on January 6, 2021 around 1400hrs, along the Harare-Chinhoyi road near Gwebi Bridge,” Nyathi said in a statement. “Three complainants were travelling in a Toyota Hilux single cab vehicle on their way to Chinhoyi on a cash-in transit task. “On board they had seven cash boxes containing approximately US$2,5 million and $40 000). “Along the way they picked up six male passengers at Westgate and Inkomo turn-off. “On approaching the Gwebi Bridge lay-bye, the driver stopped the vehicle as one of the complainants said he wanted to relieve himself. “One of the passengers then produced a pistol and fired one shot in the air whilst his accomplices disarmed one of the complainants of his 303 rifle. “The complainants later made a report to the police. “Anyone with information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects should contact the nearest police station.” The latest robbery comes as police have been tracking notorious armed robbers who have been involved in a spate of violent crimes at business premises and private homes around the country.
