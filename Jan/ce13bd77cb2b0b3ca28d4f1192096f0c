 TOUCHED by the plight of Zimbabweans due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe-born British heavyweight boxer Dereck Chisora delivered a message of solidarity encouraging people to stay indoors and avoid getting infected and infecting others.
Chisora has held multiple heavyweight titles including the British and Commonwealth between 2010- 2011 and the European title from 2013-2014. “First of all I wanna say this to my fellow Zimbabweans; please look after yourselves, don’t go out musabude panze. It’s so difficult to stay indoors and it’s painful (because you want to fend for your families) but people are dying,” Chisora shared a video recorded message with local journalists recently. “People are dying because they don’t want to listen and heed the message from the authorities. “They say ‘let me go out and do what I have to do’ but in doing so you are getting yourself killed and also killing innocent people that you live together with. Please be careful Zimbabweans.” Sport and recreation plunged into a fresh crisis recently after the government suspended all sport following a surge in the number of Covid-19 infections and deaths. For the greater part of last year sport was in intensive care following a ban that was put in place at the end of March before sport codes classified as low risk were allowed to resume training and competitions. The Covid-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc the world over with the UK where Chisora is based recording the highest-ever daily number of Covid-19 deaths, 1 564 last Wednesday. The number of deaths due to the novel coronavirus across the UK stood at 84 767 according to reports with government figures showing that 47 525 new cases of Covid-19 had emerged in the UK in 24 hours bringing the total to 3 211 576. “Last time I spoke about this and said this pandemic was coming and when it does it will be like a whirlwind and people are dying, vanhu vari kufa,” added Chisora. “I’m here in London and right now London is locked down, no one is going out. There’s nothing like going out to buy food, people are afraid and people are dying. So please protect yourselves and take care of each other because this pandemic is deadly and it’s going to be around for the next 10-15 years. “Don’t fool yourselves and think that it’s only here today and tomorrow. Try to eat healthy, steam always, drink warm and clean water and do all you can the Zimbabwean way (traditional remedies) but please stay safe my fellow Zimbabweans.” When Covid-19 first broke out in Zimbabwe around November 2019 the British boxer embarked on a project to provide clean water to Harare’s high density of Mbare where he grew up before relocating to the UK 20 years ago. Chisora also earmarked the same project to Chitungwiza which also has a perennial water crisis. Sponsored Links
