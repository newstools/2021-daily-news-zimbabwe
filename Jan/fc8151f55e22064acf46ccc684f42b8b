 Godknows Matarutse SENIOR STAFF WRITER matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw THE government yesterday extended the current hard national coronavirus lockdown by two more weeks, as authorities bid to contain the lethal disease which continues to infect and kill many locals. At the same time, police have upped the ante against Covid-19 violators by dispatching more officers around the country to man roadblocks. This comes after the government also announced a new set of fines on Monday — including hefty penalties for not wearing masks in public and breaching the current dusk-to-dawn curfew. It also comes after Zimbabwe joined other countries such as South Africa this week, by granting the College of Primary Care Physicians of Zimbabwe (CPCPZ) controlled use of Ivermectin — among other drugs — to treat Covid-19 patients. Interestingly, the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (Mcaz) had ordered health practitioners not to use the drug, which is commonly used by veterinarians to treat animals. Speaking in a televised address yesterday, Acting President Constantino Chiwenga said President Emmerson Mnangagwa had decided to extend the current stay-at-home order to try and mitigate the growing spread of Covid-19 in the country. Chiwenga, who is also Health and Child Care minister, said the decision by Mnangagwa to extend the hard lockdown to February 15 was informed by the “worrisome” coronavirus situation. “Fellow Zimbabweans, we continue to see a high number of Covid-19 cases and, sadly, deaths. In the last week, our new cases have been averaging 300 per day, with deaths averaging 20 per day. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Cumulative cases as at 1st of January … were 14 084 and deaths were 369. As at 28th January … cumulative cases reached 32 646, with deaths breaching the one thousand mark to give us 1 160. The situation is clearly worrisome,” he said. Chiwenga also said the government would intensify Covid-19 testing across all provinces, adding that Zimbabwe very likely already had new coronavirus strains circulating in the country. “The level four national lockdown that came into effect on the 5th of January … has stabilised our situation. In relative terms and since the lockdown, the number of infections have been decreasing substantially. “Equally, our recovery rate has gone up from an all-time low of 54 percent to the current … 75 percent. Even though the numbers we are losing to the pandemic are falling, we bemoan the fact that Zimbabweans are dying. “Any death is one death too many. Still, we need to stay the course by upping our vigilance. The war is not yet won,” Chiwenga added. “It is in this light that … President Mnangagwa has decided to extend the level four national lockdown by another two weeks to the 15th of February 2021. “The president fully appreciates the difficulties which come with this extension. Livelihoods are being disrupted, yet we must save lives and our nation. We must not lose the momentum,” he said further. All this comes as the virulent respiratory disease has killed more than 600 people in the past three weeks alone — including ministers and business executives, highlighting the humungous task that authorities have in curbing its further spread in the country. On Monday, the country recorded its worst daily fatalities toll to date, with 70 people succumbing to the disease — and surpassing the previous high of 60 deaths that was recorded two weeks ago. Yesterday, police increased the number of officers at all major checkpoints across the country, in a bid to stop unsanctioned movement by defiant citizens. For example, several motorists and individuals without verified exemption letters were turned away from entering the Harare central business district (CBD) yesterday. It was a similar case in Bulawayo, as police patrols were in full force in the CBD and several suburbs, ensuring compliance with lockdown protocols. In the case of Bulawayo, police launched a new operation, Udingani eTown (What are you looking for in town?), to clamp down on motorists and pedestrians violating lockdown regulations. More than 200 vehicles have so far been impounded in the second city under the operation. “This is exactly the reason why we are tightening the screws. People are not obeying the lockdown protocols and it’s a huge cause for concern. “We have since realised that there are now private cars which are pirating and we have arrested a number of them. “As police, we keep on emphasising the need for people to stay home. Why wait to be arrested to conform?” police national spokesperson Paul Nyathi told the Daily News yesterday. All this is happening after authorities on Monday gazetted new fines for those breaching Covid-19 regulations. Under the new fines, those who are caught not wearing a mask or not properly covering their face will be liable to a $5 000 fine — up from the previous $500 which was set in March last year when the government introduced the first hard coronavirus lockdown. The new fines include a jaw-dropping $1,6 million penalty for the highest level offence, and kick-in at a time that police are grappling with increasing cases of people contravening Covid-19 regulations that were imposed by authorities to mitigate the pandemic. “Level one, two and three offences now attract fines of $1 000, $2 000 and $5 000. Fines go up to level 14 which attracts a $1 600 000 fine,” authorities said in a government gazette on Monday. Level one to three offenders will pay deposit fines at police stations. They include cases such as common assault and public consumption of alcohol. Level four to 14 offences are handled by the courts. Sponsored Links
