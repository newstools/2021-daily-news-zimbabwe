A MT PLEASANT man has been arrested for raping his married ex-lover after threatening to leak her nude pictures which they sent each other during their fling over a decade ago.  Loveson Mbengeranwa is accused of coercing the woman into having sex, threatening to send nude pictures they shot 11 years ago to her husband. In fear, the woman reportedly gave in to Mbengeranwa’s demands for sex. After the alleged act, Mbengeranwa is alleged to have gone on to leak the pictures.  Mbengeranwa was not asked to plead to the allegations when he appeared before Harare magistrate Denis Mangosi. He was also charged for distributing sexual content online.  Prosecutor Anesu Chirenje told the court that sometime last year, Mbengeranwa sent the woman a message saying he still loved her.  He also threatened to send her nude pictures to her husband and relatives if she refused to sleep with him.  Mbengeranwa also alleged to have threatened to kill her husband and children if she refused to sleep with him.  The woman, after the threats, reportedly gave in and slept with him and during the act Mbengeranwa allegedly took other pictures and kept them in his phone.  It is alleged that he kept on soliciting for sex, threatening to leak the pictures, but the woman declined to give in to his demands.  Mbengeranwa allegedly went on to create a WhatsApp group and added the woman and her husband and workmates and then sent the pictures in the group.  This led the woman to make a police report, leading to the arrest of the Mbengeranwa.
