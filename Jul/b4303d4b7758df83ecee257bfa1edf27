Renowned commercial bank CBZ recently announced the launch of CBZ Tap to Pay and Win promotion. Running from 1 July 2021 to 31 August 2021, the promotion aims to build a habit of utilising the contactless option instead of swiping for CBZ clients. Contactless Payment service enables clients with CBZ contactless debit cards to transact on CBZ Point of Sale (POS) devices by holding the card in front of the payment device instead of swiping and inserting. Furthermore, this mode of payment has proven to be convenient, smart, fast and secure. “CBZ Bank has been deliberately encouraging its clients to utilise digital channels which is a good initiative in light of Covid 19 regulations where unnecessary movement of people is discouraged. “CBZ clients can perform most of their transactions through CBZ Touch and internet banking,” CBZ said in a statement. The promotion holds weekly draws where five randomly selected winners will receive ZWL 5,000 cash prizes. The grand-prize draw will be held at the end of the promotion where 3 lucky clients will walk away with ZWL25,000, ZWL15,000 and ZWL10,000 in cash prizes respectively. CBZ Clients must tap their contactless debit cards on CBZ Point of Sale (POS) machines to purchase goods at any retail outlet for them to get an entry into the draw.
