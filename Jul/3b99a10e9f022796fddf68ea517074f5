Econet Wireless has confirmed the review of its promotional bundle prices, saying the average 20 percent adjustment effective tomorrow (July 8) was necessitated by rising costs. “The bundle price adjustment is an average 20 percent uplift across the board, and is essentially in response to rising input costs,” a company spokesman said.
