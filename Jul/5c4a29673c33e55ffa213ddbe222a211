CHENJERAI Kangausaru, who is considered as a jack of all trades, says he owes everything to his late father Dan Kawocha-Kangausaru. His father succumbed to asthma-related illness at the age of 84 last week in South Africa and he is set to be buried in his rural home in Hurungwe next week. “He played a crucial role in my life and be where I am today is all because of him. I emulate him in many ways and surely I will miss him dfearly. He taught me how to be independent in life,” South Africa based philanthropist, music promoter and cleric Kangausaru said. Kangausaru who is also into politics— currently the Zanu PF Hurungwe East District Coordinating Committee secretary for legal affairs— told this publication he will work hard to uphold his father’s legacy. “He had a big heart. He assisted many struggling children with school fees, food and clothes among others mainly in Hurungwe. The community looked up to him and I can say the life will never be the same again without him.” Taking a leaf from his father, Kangausaru in 2018 donated some groceries to Cyclone Idai hit areas Chimanimani and Chipinge. He also paid school fees for the less privileged children from Hurungwe East constituency. Kangausaru who runs chain of businesses, from transport, agriculture, sports to education in South Africa vows to transform Hurungwe.  “Even though his shoes are too big to fill, I will do my best to uphold his legacy. I believe education is key in life; plans of building a private primary and secondary schools as well as tertiary colleges are under way in Hurungwe,” Kangausaru said.
