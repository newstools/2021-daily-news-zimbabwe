MDC Alliance vice-chairman and Zengeza West legislator Job Sikhala’s trial was off to a false start yesterday, as the prosecutor in the matter is reportedly in isolation after coming into contact with a colleague who tested positive for Covid-19. Sikhala is facing allegations of inciting public violence through social media ahead of the July 31, 2020 demonstration. The case was postponed to July 14 for trial, amid reports the presiding magistrate Lazini Ncube had recused himself from the matter. Allegations against Sikhala are that he used social media to incite violence by stating that: “People from Zambezi to Limpopo to Forbes Border Post to Victoria Falls July 31, 2020 should be your day”. “This is the kind of war that we have. If we do not fight this war nothing will come out until we die. These men have oppressed the people for a long time. This time they have to kill, really kill us. These men have stolen our youth. “We did not enjoy it at all. All the people in London are heeding the message that on the day they will besiege our embassies, even those in America they will be in action on 21 and 31 July. Those in Australia and South Africa are all saying they will be taking action. I will fight the State since I am not easily intimidated,” he reportedly said. Meanwhile, the Harare Magistrates’ court yesterday closed early for fumigation purposes as the Judicial Service Commission stepped up efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19.
