TWO suspected armed robbers, Norman Karenga and Robert Mhandu, who were arrested early this year following a police raid in Kuwadzana, Harare, have been denied bail by the High Court. In a recent judgment, High Court judge Pisirai Kwenda ruled that the duo had failed to provide evidence of their residential addresses, adding that they were likely to abscond if freed on bail. “The applicants have failed to explain away incriminating evidence. They have also failed to place evidence before this court which shows that they have strong ties with the place of trial and its environs. They have no assets. “There is, therefore, nothing that ties them to the place of trial or its jurisdiction. It is easy for them to live a nomadic life,” Kwenda said. According to court papers, the two were arrested after three highway robbery victims filed a police report. The police linked the duo to four robberies which had occurred on January 4, 5 and 17 and February 20 this year. The police raided Mhandu’s house in Kuwadzana and arrested him after they found evidence linking him to two of the crimes.  “The stolen Zimbabwe passport and bunch of keys were recovered from him. The recovery linked him to the three counts of robbery committed on January 4, 2021. “The floral jacket and mask stolen in the robbery which occurred on February 5, 2021 was also recovered from the second applicant at the time of his arrest thereby linking him to the said robbery,” part of the court papers read. Karenga was arrested after being implicated by Mhandu.
