ZIMBABWE has received US$75 million from the Global Fund to complement government efforts in the fight against the lethal Covid-19 pandemic.     This comes as the government has already committed $11 billion from its coffers since coronavirus hit the country’s shores in March last year.     Speaking at a post-Cabinet media briefing in Harare last night, Information minister Monica Mutsvangwa, pictured, said the government had resolved to set up a virtual hospital for the management of Covid-19 patients.     “The allocation (Global Fund) is for three years, from 2021 to 2023. It should, however, be noted that the government continues to provide resources from its own coffers for the Covid-19 response programme, with $11 billion having been released since the onset of the outbreak,” Mutsvangwa said.     She said vaccination against the virus was progressing smoothly across the country.     As of Monday, Mutsvangwa added, 353 834 people had received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and 57 776 their second.     “On a related matter, government efforts in refurbishing and upgrading health facilities are beginning to yield the desired results. Government is pleased to announce that Ekusileni Medical Centre has been fully refurbished and will soon be opened officially,” she said.     “Thorngrove Hospital was refurbished and upgraded to a 28-bed fully equipped Covid-19 isolation centre and is admitting Covid-19 patients.     “The first-ever free orthopaedic paediatric hospital and Covid-19 isolation centre at United Bulawayo Hospital is also set to be officially opened soon. The hospital will attend to children with various orthopaedic conditions, including those with congenital deformities from all over the country.”     In a development set to revolutionise Covid-19 management, cabinet adopted a proposal to set up a virtual hospital out of a realisation that most patients were recovering without symptoms or after experiencing mild ones, which do not require hospitalisation.      “Government will establish a provisional figure of 10 000 to 20 000 home-based beds.  A network of health staff will carry out protocol based monitoring and management of the cases. The equipment support for this programme is as follows: rechargeable oxygen concentrators; finger pulse or saturation monitors; non-contact thermometers; blood glucose testing machines and blood pressure machines     “The equipment will be deployed to the admitted patients and returned when the patient is discharged. The establishment of the virtual hospital will, therefore, alleviate the pressure on hospitals,” Mutsvangwa added.     On crop and livestock assessment, the minister said the country was poised for a bumper harvest following the good rains.     Maize production is estimated at 2 717 171 metric tonnes, 199 percent higher than the 907 628 metric tonnes produced in the 2019/2020 season.     Traditional grains are projected at 347 968 metric tonnes, which is 128 percent more than the 152 515 metric tonne output of the previous season.     Cereal production is expected to reach 3 075 538 metric tonnes, against a national cereal requirement of 1 797 435 metric tonnes for human consumption and 450 000 metric tonnes for livestock.      Soyabean production is expected to increase by 51 percent to 71 290 metric tonnes from 47 088 metric tonnes last year, while the sweet potato yield is estimated to increase by 269 percent, sugar beans by 142 percent and groundnuts by 139 percent.     “The assessment further indicates that while the livestock situation still requires attention, there has been a marked improvement in the state of affairs.     The national beef cattle herd increased from 5 443 770 in the previous season to 5 478 648 this season, and the average national cattle mortality rate decreased from 12 percent in 2019 to 4,2 percent in 2020 due to improved disease control efforts, such as from the Presidential Tick Grease Scheme, and improved nutrition due to the good rainy season,” Mutsvangwa said.     “Egg production is increasing, reaching a new high of 59,3 million dozen in 2020, surpassing the 2019 production by 18 percent (which was 50,4 million dozens) and seven percent higher than the previous record of 55,3 million in 2016.”
