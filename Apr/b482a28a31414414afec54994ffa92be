Tamary Chikiwa     in BULAWAYO          THE church in Bulawayo has pledged to assist the government in fighting Covid-19 through opening some of its infrastructure for vaccination to ease pressure on health institutions.     Bishop Mpande Khanye, one of the church leaders in the city, said besides offering emotional support, they were also willing to provide human resources.     “We have buildings that are church-owned and we are willing to temporarily give them to the government to administer vaccinations,” he said.     Khanye said the church was also helping with personal protective equipment(PPE) among other needs in fighting the virus.     “Recently the church donated some beds at Thorngrove and we have been supplying PPE to schools as we help the government in fighting Covid-19. This is the time when the government and church should hold hands in fighting this pandemic,” he said.     Khanye challenged other men-of-cloth to be non-selective in offering their services that are Covid-19-related.     “We are not focusing on Christians only but on everyone because we are all children of Zimbabwe and of God. This calls for unity among us all as Zimbabweans,” he said.     Khanye said the church also assists in conscientising the public and encouraging them to follow lockdown rules and regulations.     “Church leaders meet citizens regularly during church services and we make sure that we encourage them to adhere to lockdown regulations. We make sure that even in our sermons we conscientise our members so that they do not give our security forces headaches,” he said.     Khanye added:  “The church is very critical and just like other government departments it should be part of the Covid-19 taskforce committee so that it’s up to date in terms of development. Once we know what’s lacking as a church we can help source funds. Both government and church should bear the burden together for this is our Zimbabwe together”
