ABOUT 60 theatre practitioners are set to clean-up Harare tomorrow as part of an exercise being spearheaded by the Zimbabwe Theatre Academy in partnership with organisations such as Dairibord and the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC).     Zimbabwe Theatre Academy director Lloyd Nyikadzino said the clean-up, which has the blessing of the Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation ministry and the Environmental Management Agency, would be the first of many.     “This is our first clean-up campaign. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, we are looking at about 60 artists who will come at intervals,” said Nyikadzino.     He said as theatre practitioners they felt they had to do something about the capital’s unclean environment.      “The Zimbabwe Theatre Academy had an outdoor learning activity with our students at Cleveland Dam on April 6 where we were exploring and relating the forces of nature to theatre training fundamentals and our pedagogy at large.     “As we were doing this we found that there was a need to clean-up the area to reduce pollution and in turn enhancing the aesthetic value and the natural beauty of the area and assisting in addressing issues of climate change,” he said.     In August last year, musicians such as sculptor Dominic Benhura, Martin Chabuka, Leonard Mapfumo and Nyasha David among others cleaned up Kamunhu Shopping Centre in Mabvuku in the capital in partnership with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe.
