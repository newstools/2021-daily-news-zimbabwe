CORRUPTION-accused Harare City Council officials Hosiah Chisango, Addmore Nhekairo and Samuel Nyabezi’s trial has been set for May 26.     Chisango is the suspended town clerk, while Nhekairo is suspended director of Housing and Community Services and Nyabezi is the acting town planner.     The three — currently out of custody on $50 000 bail each — are facing criminal abuse of office, bribery and fraud charges.     Allegations against the three are that in July 2019, Chisango and his accomplices hatched a plan to allocate residential stands on an open area in Kuwadzana 3.     They allegedly developed a fake plan and no application was made to the Local Government ministry for change of land use as required in terms of the Urban Councils Act.     It is alleged that Chisango then gave 13 provisional allocation letters to Bluffhope Investments managing director Getrude Dumba to facilitate procurement, development and survey of the stands on their behalf.     Chisango allegedly signed the letters which bore the Department of Housing and Community Services letterhead.     He then instructed Dumba to deposit $130 000, being the intrinsic value of the land and a further $100 000, into a corporate bank account registered in the name of GlenRoy Private Limited and another $100 000 into Kennedy Terechire’s bank account as a consideration for the fraudulent allocation of land, it is alleged.     According to the State, Chisango received the “gift” knowing there was a possibility that it was not due to them in terms of any agreement with their principal, the Harare Municipality.     It was further alleged that in September 2019, Chisango misrepresented to Bluffhope that council had land which had been approved for residential stands in Kuwadzana 3.     The court heard that Chisango then made Nyabezi draft a layout knowing that the said allocation plan does not exist, before asking Bluffhope to deposit $130 000 into council’s account.
