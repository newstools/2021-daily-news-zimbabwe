BUS operators caught smuggling goods through the country’s ports of entry risk losing their travel and route permits, the police have said.     The police have impounded 42 buses since March 1, four of which were seized at the Beitbridge Border Post last Friday while trying to smuggle groceries and electrical goods into the country.     The buses impounded recently belong to Sibbs Express, Mzanzi, Charazim and Inter Africa companies.     “The government has been clear about the course of action to be taken against those contravening Covid-19 regulations and we have also received numerous reports from members of the public complaining about the smuggling of goods.     “We are going to engage the relevant ministry to ensure that bus operators found contravening the law lose their permits and route authority,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi told the Daily News.     Nyathi said since Zimbabwean borders remained closed, errant bus operators were taking advantage of repatriations being facilitated by the government and development partners to smuggle goods into the country.      “This will expose people to the risk of contracting the Covid-19 virus,” Nyathi added.— TARISAI MACHAKAIRE
