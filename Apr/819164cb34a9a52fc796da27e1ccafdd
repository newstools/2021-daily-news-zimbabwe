THE Grade 7 pass rate for Harare City Council primary schools that sat for last year’s Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (Zimsec) tests has declined by eight percent, the council’s education committee has said.     This comes as the 2020 national pass rate dropped by 9, 79 percent from 46, 9 percent in 2019 to 37,11 percent.      “A total of 6 632 learners from council administered schools sat for the 2020 Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council Grade 7 examinations. The average pass rate by subject had decreased by 7,78 percent from 79,67 percent in 2019 to 71, and 89 percent in 2020,” minutes from a recent council meeting showed after a sample of 33 primary schools which were operational during the period.     HCC said it was working towards registering one of its schools, Tariro Primary, as an examination centre since pupils at the institution had to use other centres to sit for the 2020 examinations.     “The first Grade 7 class at Tariro Council Primary School sat for the examinations at Shiriyedenga and Mhizha Government Primary Schools respectively because the school was not registered as an examination centre,” council said. — TARISAI MACHAKAIRE
