BULAWAYO province has embarked on consultations in a bid to come up with a provincial development strategic plan aimed at reviving defunct industries in the city and broadly benefit the national economy.     This comes after the government recently launched the National Development Strategy One (NDS1), a five-year economic blueprint aimed at realising the country’s vision 2030.      Following the launch of the strategy, each province was asked to come up with its priorities which are in line with national interests.     Presenting proposed developmental priorities during a consultation workshop in Bulawayo yesterday, the provincial development coordinator Paul Nyoni said that the province was giving top priority to infrastructural development and resuscitation of industries.     “The national thrust is economic growth and stability and as Bulawayo we have a critical role to play since we were once the country’s industrial hub,” he said.     Nyoni added that the province was looking forward to resuscitating the leather industry as well.      The proposed themes also include economic development, food security, governance and environmental management. — TAMARY CHIKIWA
