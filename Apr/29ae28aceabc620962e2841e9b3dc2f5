ZIMBABWE have included three uncapped players for the upcoming three-match T20I series and two Tests against Pakistan.     In-form young batsman Tadiwanashe Marumani, seamer Tanaka Chivanga and spin bowler Tapiwa Mufudza are the three youngsters who earned their maiden call-ups after impressive performances recently.     Marumani, in particular, impressed during the just ended 2020/21 Domestic T20 competition in which he notched an impressive four fifties in five matches.     Sean Williams will captain Zimbabwe for the three matches while Brendan Taylor and Craig Ervine also made a comeback after overcoming health challenges coupled with some decent performances in the domestic T20 competition.     Taylor and Ervine were not part of the squad that toured the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a series against Afghanistan recently owing to illness.     Luke Jongwe, who last featured in international cricket in January 2016, also bounced back after he was included in the 15-man squad. However, there was no place for Sikandar Raza, who was ruled out due to an upper-arm injury.     However, Richmond Mutumbami, Milton Shumba, Brandon Mavuta, Tarisai Musakanda and Faraz Akram, who were part of the squad that toured UAE, did not make the cut for the Pakistan match.     Musakanda has, however, been placed on standby alongside Ainsley Ndlovu and Bradley Evans.     Zimbabwe will play three T20Is and two Tests against Pakistan starting Wednesday at the Harare Sports Club. The series starts with the T20Is, which will be played on April 21, 23 and 25, with the Test matches set for April 29 to May 3 and May 7 to 11.     This will be the second time that Zimbabwe and Pakistan are meeting since the Covid-19 pandemic rattled the world at the end of 2019.     Zimbabwe toured Pakistan to play three ODIs and three T20Is in October-November last year. Pakistan won the ODI series 2-1 and the T20I series 3-0. The teams have not played Test cricket against each other since Pakistan visited Zimbabwe in September 2013.     All the games will be played behind closed doors and no spectators are allowed inside the stadium due to Covid-19 protocols.     Pakistan arrived in the country on Saturday following a successful tour of South Africa, in which they won both ODI and T20I series with players earning various achievements.     Zimbabwe T20I Squad:     Williams Sean (captain), Burl Ryan, Chakabva Regis, Chivanga Tanaka, Ervine Craig, Jongwe Luke, Kamunhukamwe Tinashe, Madhevere Wessly, Marumani Tadiwanashe, Masakadza Wellington, Mufudza Tapiwa, Muzarabani Blessing, Ngarava Richard, Taylor Brendan, Tiripano Donald
