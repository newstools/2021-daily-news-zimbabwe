ARTS minister Kirsty Coventry, pictured, has announced the appointment of six more trustees to the board of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ) which had been under the leadership of five members since 2017.     The just-appointed board members are Moris Mpala (banking and financial expert), Bryn Mteki (sculptor and entrepreneur), Nigel Phillip (businessperson), Joyce Chimanye (fashion designer), Pikirayi Deketeke (communications guru) and Chelsea Evans (information and technology expert).     The six join the NGZ board members appointed in 2017 — Solomon Guramatunhu (chairperson), Busani Bafana, Job Torindoh, Patricia Wood and David Scott.     In her speech, Coventry urged the now 11-member board to familiarise itself with the national arts, culture and heritage policy and the national culture and creative industries (CCIs) strategy.     “It is from these documents you will be gleaning information as you develop your own strategic plan.      “Furthermore, I expect you to come up with your own visual arts strategy that derives from the overarching National CCIs Strategy,” Coventry told the new board members.     The arts minister singled out piracy as one of the main challenges that the board should confront.     “In order to guarantee the development of quality products, the government is keen to institutionalise quality training that will help to re-claim the visual arts market niche and arrest piracy. At the same time, there is a need to create robust market distribution systems both locally and globally,” Coventry said.
