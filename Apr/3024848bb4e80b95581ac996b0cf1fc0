THE late former Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) commissioner-general Paradzai Zimondi’s estate executors, C. Nhemwa & Associates, have invited debtors and creditors to lodge their claims with them within 30 days.     This was published in the Government Gazette on Friday.      “All persons having claims against the under-mentioned estates are required to lodge them in detail with the executor or representative concerned within the stated periods, calculated from the date of publication hereof, and those indebted thereto are required to pay to the executor or representative the amounts due by them within the same period, failing which legal proceedings will be taken for the recovery thereof,” the notice reads.      Zimondi, who was 74 at the time of his death on January 22 this year, succumbed to Covid-19-related complications at the height of the pandemic’s second wave in Zimbabwe.      He was buried at the National Heroes Acres together with Cabinet ministers Sibusiso Moyo and Joel Biggie Matiza, who also died of Covid-19.      Zimondi retired as ZPCS boss in November last year after 22 years of service.
