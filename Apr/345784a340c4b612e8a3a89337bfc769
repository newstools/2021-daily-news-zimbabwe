THIS year’s Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), scheduled for July, should play a pivotal role in engaging and forging innovative and sustainable trade models with potential to create new opportunities, the organising firm’s chairperson, Busisa Moyo, has said.     This comes as the government recently announced that the annual event, which is traditionally held in April, would be held from July 20-23 in Bulawayo.     “ZITF 2021 presents an ideal platform for stakeholders to converge and rebuild businesses while navigating the contours of the new normal which has become largely buttressed by technology and navigate new regional and global developments,” Moyo said.     The event returns after taking a hiatus last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and is being held under the theme: “Showcasing The New Normal for Business and Industry: Realities and Opportunities”.     “ZITF 2021 will be taking place as the country and indeed the world begins the long trek of recovery following the negative economic impacts of the global pandemic, Covid-19, which has left many countries throughout the globe reeling from business closures owing to lockdowns, depressed demand and all-round devastation across economic sectors. In the background of this devastating pandemic, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Brexit, among other global trade shifts, became a reality at the beginning of 2021,” Moyo said.
