BULAWAYO      BUREAU CHIEF     A BULAWAYO lawyer, Nqobani Sithole, has filed a Constitutional Court application challenging the passage of the Constitutional Amendment Bill No.1 in the Senate, which among other things allows President Emmerson Mnangagwa to handpick the chief justice.     In the application filed last Friday, Sithole of Ncube Attorneys argued that Parliament “failed to exercise its legislative authority” by reviving the Bill in March this year, when its time lapsed upon the dissolution of the eighth Parliament on July 29, 2018.     In the Zimbabwean context, Parliament has a five-year term, which means a Bill raised during the previous session is rendered dead when a new Parliament is sworn-in.     The current ninth Parliament was opened on September 18, 2018.     Sithole argued that by restoring the Bill, subsequently passed in the Senate on April 6, Parliament violated Section 147 of the Constitution.     He further argued that if Parliament desired to proceed with the Bill, “it should have commenced the process afresh in keeping with the procedures prescribed in Section 131 of the Constitution”.     Sithole is now seeking an order declaring the passage of the Bill to be of no legal effect.     In the application, the lawyer cited Parliament, the Speaker of National Assembly Jacob Mudenda, president of the Senate Mabel Chinomona, Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi and Mnangagwa as respondents.     This also comes as another Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 2 sailed through the National Assembly last week and is now waiting for the president’s assent.     The Bill seeks to among other things remove the running mate clause.
