AUTHORITIES have raised concern over the low uptake of the Covid-19 vaccines at Plumtree Border Post after only 900 people were vaccinated since the inoculation programme commenced in February against a target of over 8 000 adults.     The targeted population in the border town include officials from the department of immigration, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra), agriculture department, police, military and intelligence.     Plumtree district officer Joe Ngonono told Health deputy minister John Mangwiro, during a ministerial visit in the area, that vaccine uptake was low, as the majority of officials were hesitant to get vaccinated.     “I might not be sure of the exact number of officials who have been vaccinated, but there are 12 Zimra officials, nine from the agricultural department, two clearing agents and eight from immigration. This is worrisome because if we want to reach the target of 8 950, we need to vaccinate more people,” he said.     Mangwiro warned the officials to take the vaccination programme seriously, saying they were prone to new variants from Botswana and South Africa as the border is a gateway to the two countries.     “There is a need for you to cooperate here because you are not even a big city that should have problems in giving higher offices information on who has been vaccinated and who has not. There are immigrants from Botswana and South Africa who might bring different variants. There is a need for unity to avoid disaster,” Mangwiro said. — TAMARY CHIKIWA
