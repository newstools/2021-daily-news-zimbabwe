AT LEAST 121 dairy farmers across the country’s 10 provinces are tomorrow set to receive in-calf heifers from the European Union (EU)-funded Transforming Zimbabwe’s Dairy Value Chain (TranZDVC) programme, which is projected to increase milk production by 45 million litres by next year.     TranZDVC project coordinator Edson Chifamba said at least 48, 76 percent of the beneficiaries to the 147 in-calf heifers worth US$129 037 are women, credited for playing a key role in agriculture and many other facets of the economy.     “TranZDVC is a four-year initiative targeting 4 000 small-to-medium scale dairy farmers and larger anchor dairy farms and aims to address the root causes of the under-performance of the dairy value chain in Zimbabwe     “Through the importation of the in-calf heifers, TranZDVC will increase the production of milk in Zimbabwe from 75 million litres (in 2018) to 120 million litres (by 2022) per year and increasing the participation of small-scale farmers, especially women and youth, in the dairy value chain,” Chifamba said.     Zimbabwe’s dairy herd of 123 000 cows in the 1990s produced more than 260 million litres of milk annually, but production declined over the years, with an estimated 39 000 dairy cows left.     In 2020, the nation produced 76, 7 million litres of milk against an annual demand of 130 million litres hence there is a deficit of more than 54 million litres.     The heifers sourced by We Effect Zimbabwe together with its implementing partners, the Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers, Zimbabwe Farmers Union and the Zimbabwe Dairy Industry Trust, is also part of a €40 million EU-funded Zimbabwe Agricultural Growth Programme (ZAGP) aimed at tackling challenges within the country’s livestock sector through offering financial support.     ZAGP seeks to contribute to the development of a diversified and efficient agriculture sector that promotes inclusive green economic growth.     Covering Zimbabwe’s 10 provinces, the programme is addressing the weaknesses and gaps in livestock value chains that have hampered the sector from increasing production and incomes to their potential.     Focus is on increasing profitability, building the capacity of farmers, service institutions and the private sector through increased investment, institutional reforms and policy alignment.
