AN unlicenSed kombi driver has been jailed for four years after he ploughed into people at a bus terminus in Harare central business district, killing a nine-year-old child.     Archford Chikoto, 18, was banned from driving and further slapped with a $10 000 fine for driving without a licence, while the four years in prison were for culpable homicide.     According to court papers, the incident took place on December 30 last year when Chikoto was driving a commuter omnibus at the Fourth Street bus terminus in Harare.     A speeding Chikoto failed to control the vehicle, ploughed into people who were waiting for transport, hitting the minor, who was in the company of her sister.     Chikoto did not stop after the accident, while the minor died a few hours later at a private hospital.     The court ruled that Chikoto was negligent for speeding and failure to keep a proper lookout on the road.     Prosecutor Caroline Mutimusakwa appeared for the State.
