NON-GOVERNMENTAL organisation, World Vision Zimbabwe, through its Bicycle Education Empowerment Programme (BEEP), has donated over 100 bicycles to school-going girls in Plumtree who used to walk 20 kilometres to and from school daily.     BEEP chairperson Jotham Nhliziyo said the donation, funded by UKAid, comes as part of the Improving Gender, Attitudes, Transition and Education Outcomes-Transition (IGATE) project, being held in collaboration with the Education ministry.      “We realised that most of them missed school as they could not manage the distance. Our thrust is to help the girl-child proceed with school,” Nhliziyo said.     The programme being implemented in Mangwe, Plumtree, Chivi and Mberengwa, among other districts, is targeting girls walking more than five kilometres to and from school.     “Most rural schools walk very long distances to and from school and this has contributed to a rise in school drop outs.      “These bicycles are meant to reduce the time they spend travelling to and from school.     “Once the girls have their own bicycles, they can conveniently travel home and get there on time. We are avoiding a case whereby they get home dark because it exposes them to abusers,” he said. — TAMARY CHIKIWA
