A Harare law firm has written to the Law Society of Zimbabwe (LSZ) and the police to stop one of its former employees from masquerading as one of their legal practitioners. Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners want Liberty Mandiveyi stopped forthwith from practising using their name. “We refer to the above mentioned legal practitioner who used to be employed with us  up to November 2019. ““It has come to our attention that Liberty Mandiveyi is operating as a legal practitioner and passing off as if he is still practicing under our firm. “For the record … Mandiveyi is no longer with us,” one of the firm’s partners, Everson Chatambudza said in his letter to the LSZ. It has come to our attention that about ten (10) days ago he allegedly appeared before Chegutu Magistrates Court wherein he purported to be from our law firm.  “He was then ordered to produce his current practicing certificate but he failed to produce same resulting in him being handed over to the Zimbabwe Republic Police for further management. “By copy of this letter we are informing the Judicial Service Commission and ZRP to be on the lookout for this individual for he may commit criminal acts on the false basis of being employed by us thereby prejudicing us as well as unsuspecting members of the public,” Chatambudza further said.
