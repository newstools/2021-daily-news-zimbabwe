VICE President Constantino Chiwenga’s estranged wife Marry’s assault case was yesterday pushed to September 6 as she could not stand trial due to ill health. Marry, who is now moving with an assistant, with a drainage system attached to her hand, sat in the dock while leaning on the shoulder of her aide during her brief appearance in court. Her lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa applied for the postponement of the matter to October 6, citing her client’s health condition, but the State proposed September 6, saying the date provided enough time for officials to monitor her progress. Harare regional magistrate Noel Mupeiwa agreed to have the matter postponed to September 6, after ruling that any period further than that will pose difficulties in managing the case. He said that there was a need to monitor Marry’s condition before witnesses were called to court. The trial has been postponed on several occasions to allow Marry to recover from her illness. Marry is accused of assaulting Chiwenga’s maid, Delight Munyoro, after she went to collect her children from school. The State alleges she clashed with Munyoro resulting in the assault. Marry is, however, denying the allegations. The former model is also facing money laundering charges, which were on Monday postponed to September 30, to allow her full recovery.
