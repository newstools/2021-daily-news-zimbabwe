FORMER Cabinet minister Prisca Mupfumira insists she will not flee from justice after appearing in court yesterday to cancel warrants of arrests that had been issued against her.  The court had declared Mupfumira, who is facing criminal charges, a fugitive after she had flown to South Africa last month to attend a Pan-African Parliament (PAP) session.  The former Public Service and Social Welfare minister had sought both the government and court’s authority to travel across the Limpopo on Parliament business which was granted.   However, in a surprise turn of events, the State had insinuated that Mupfumira had skipped the country and had no permission to travel down South.     Through her lawyer Admire Rubaya, Mupfumira averred that she has nothing to hide and will not flee prosecution.  “She asserts that all the naysayers who were attacking her that she would not return, she has nothing to hide and has returned to clear her name.   “She has shown that she can be trusted with her liberty that she can travel to another country and return without fleeing,” Rubaya submitted.  The State did not oppose the application resulting in regional magistrate Stanford Mambanje cancelling the warrants. In one of the cases before the court, Mupfumira is facing allegations of abuse of duty as a public officer.  She is accused of corruptly concealing a transaction involving a US$90 000 loan application from the National Social Security Authority for the purchase of a supposed ministerial vehicle and the flying of ministry officials for her daughter’s wedding in South Africa.
