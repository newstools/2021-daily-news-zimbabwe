GIANT telecoms firm, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, says its rebranding is aimed at creating a more interactive business and mapping of possible solutions to connect all schools in Africa to the Internet. Speaking during a virtual press conference, celebrating 100 000 km of Liquid fibre yesterday, the company’s group chief executive officer (CEO) Nic Rudnick said Liquid Intelligent Technologies was mandated to fully equip Zimbabwean learners with the advanced technology they want. “In this world of change, education needs to sustain its critical role in helping people forge successful careers, pursue happy lives and positively engage in society. “The importance of education is constant … We need a new approach to education that flows naturally like modern life … we have got every single school mapped in Zimbabwe on this open source system. “From polytechnics to universities, Liquid Intelligent Technologies’ Edu-Zones empower and equip learning institutions with free internet in the form of Wi-Fi zones — typically in cafeterias, halls of residence and sports fields where students congregate. “Since its launch 18 months ago, thousands of tertiary level students are enjoying free Internet access through Edu-Zones located at 48 higher and tertiary learning institutions across Zimbabwe,” Rudnick said. He further said the company’s efforts in digitising Africa were bearing fruit, enabling people and businesses across the continent with unprecedented access to cloud, voice and digital services. “In connecting African countries to their neighbours and the rest of the world, we ensure that Africa’s digital future is an intelligent one,” he said.
