COPS in Bulawayo have arrested two security guards for allegedly impersonating police officers, as similar cases continue to rise in the country.  Mduduzi Dube, 31, and Fanuel Ncube, 29, both from Pumula South, are employed as security guards at an unnamed organisation in the city, police said.  Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Abednico Ncube said the two were arrested on June 26 at Centenary Park in the city and are now facing charges of impersonating police officers.   “The complainant (name not availed) was approached by the accused persons and was asked why he was not wearing his mask.   “One of the accused persons showed the complainant some handcuffs and advised him that he was under arrest for not wearing a mask.  “The two accused persons then asked the complainant how much money he had and he offered to give them $100,” Ncube said.  “Genuine police officers from the cycle patrol unit approached them and the complainant narrated his story. The accused persons were later arrested after failing to identify themselves as police officers.”  Ncube said the duo’s arrest was a clear testimony of how criminals were tarnishing the image of the force.  “We call upon members of the public to agree to go with arresting officers to the police station to finalise legal processes, this will give criminals limited grounds for extorting money from them,” he said.  Of late, there has been many reports of people who have been arrested for impersonating law enforcement agents.  On Saturday, a Hwange man Joas Tshuma was arrested on charges of impersonating a police officer and terrorising residents.  Last week, a Bulawayo woman Vinate Ncube  was arrested after she tried to extort cash from an illegal commuter omnibus after posing off as a cop.
