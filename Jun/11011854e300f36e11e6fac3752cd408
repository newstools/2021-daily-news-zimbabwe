NATIONAL Aids Council (Nac) has partnered the Zimbabwe Ladies Golf Union (ZLGU) to promote the uptake of sexual reproductive health services in Zimbabwe. Speaking during the launch of a US$15 000 sponsorship deal towards a golf tournament which will take place in August, Nac chief executive, Bernard Madzima said they were pleased to extend their three-year working relationship with ZLGU. “The Nac has once again seen fit to continue our partnership with the ZLGU in hosting the Ladies Golf Tournament from 27-29 August this year, through which we intend to raise awareness on HIV and cancer, in particular cervical cancer, which is predominantly affecting women. “We will be providing these services to players and everyone who will be there….,” Madzima said. Madzima said HIV prevalence among women was worrying and there was a need to continuously raise awareness so that no one is left behind.  — TARIRO SAJENI
