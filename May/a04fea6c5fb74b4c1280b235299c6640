TWO Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) officers who were arrested this week Tuesday for allegedly demanding a US$9000 bribe from a Chinese businessman are set to appear in court today.     The two, Patrick Badza and Matsvimbo Chester Simbarashe were arrested by investigators from the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission     They are members of the Foreign Recruitment Committee (FRC), which is responsible for approval of Temporary Employment Permits (TEPs) for foreign employees.     The committee was set up under the National Labour Migration Policy which is designed to improve the governance of labour migration, as well as protection and empowerment of migrant workers.     Further investigations are said to be ongoing to probe suspected corruption by the FRC as some officials are frustrating TEP applications to get bribes.
