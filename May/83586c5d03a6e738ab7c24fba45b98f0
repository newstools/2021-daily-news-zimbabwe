SUSPENDED Bindura Municipality chamber secretary, Naison Machinguta has approached the High Court seeking a court order lifting his suspension pending a disciplinary hearing.     In papers filed at the High Court, Machinguta, together with Bindura Municipality finance director Lovemore Warurama, cited the Bindura Town Council (BTC) and acting town clerk Kelton Chinowaita as the respondents.     The two were suspended on April 21 after an investigation team set up by the local authority accused them of making several salary payments to five ghost workers.     The duo approached the court claiming that their suspension was illegal as Chinowaita only suspended them in an attempt to disrupt a pending court application challenging his appointment as town clerk.     “It is a … requirement of the law that whenever the office of the town clerk is vacant the chamber secretary performs functions conferred or imposed upon the town clerk.      “The first applicant (Machinguta) is actually the candidate who is expected in terms of the law to have been elevated.     “The second respondent (Chinowaita) is in effect trying to rectify the anomaly through the back door.      “In effect, if the first applicant remains on suspension, the question of irregularity in his appointment falls away as it will mean that the office of the chamber secretary of the first respondent (BTC) becomes vacant,” argued Machinguta.     Machinguta and Warurama want the court to declare the suspension null and void as they have been acquitted of some of the charges they were accused of.     “It is also interesting to note that the applicants were acquitted by the Bindura Magistrates’ Court on the same charges that are being preferred for examination by the disciplinary hearing,” added the defence.     The Bindura Town Council and Chinowaita have yet to respond to the application.
