FORMER Zanu PF Youth League national political commissar Godfrey Tsenengamu, pictured, who faces allegations of inciting public violence ahead of the foiled demonstrations in July last year, will stand trial on June 21. The trial was scheduled to take place last Thursday, but was postponed after the State witness fell ill and failed to attend, resulting in the postponement. Through his lawyer Harrison Nkomo, Tsenengamu had challenged the postponement and pushed for him to be removed from remand. Regional magistrate Stanford Mambanje, however, allowed the postponement, which he said was based on a reasonable cause. Tsenengamu stands accused of making several statements on social media ahead foiled demonstrations, which the State says were calculated to incite violence. In one of the audio recordings that the state is relying on, Tsenengamu allegedly said: “From July 31 and beyond you must know that people will die as never previously witnessed in this country.  “Masses will be heavily beaten, thievery and corruption will increase to unprecedented levels… boys and girls who are in the diaspora with parents in the country, encourage your parents to attend the protests in their numbers and fight for themselves, fight for you and fight for the country as you are being oppressed in the diaspora where you are based, so that you will be able to come to them.” According to the State, he also used his Twitter account to post: “I am not sure about the results of this approach.  “Anyway, Zimbabwe must win. The Green Revolution is saying corruption and looting must fall on July 31.” The July 31 demonstrations also led to the arrest of political figures Job Sikhala and Jacob Ngarivhume.
