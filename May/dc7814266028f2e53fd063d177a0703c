THE INDIGENISATION process under the new dispensation led by President Emmerson Mnangagwa is geared towards empowering marginalised rural communities, with the southern region being a priority, the Affirmative Action Group (AAG) has said.     In an interview the AAG communications and advocacy officer, Ari Goldstein, implored youths and women in the southern region who have business ideas to bring them forward in order to get assistance from the government.     “Indigenisation under the new dispensation has a different approach altogether. Our thrust is to support communities countrywide whether urban or rural ones… our revised policy seeks to empower them. No community should be left out so we have the southern region in mind and those with projects should come forward and we will assist them,” Goldstein said.     The AAG communications and advocacy officer said his organisation would go out of its way to fully explain the new indigenisation thrust.     “Previously people did not get enough information about the process but this time we have explained everything and we are saying the 51 percent share does not mean the government is taking away businesses from people but it simply means that the government will be hands-on in promoting locals,” he said.     Goldstein said the indigenisation policy under the new dispensation seeks to make the economy more “native”, among other things, through putting the youth in influential positions.     “We are targeting to put citizens, especially the youth, in the key economic positions in order to achieve vision 2030 if becoming a middle income economy by 2030,” he said.
